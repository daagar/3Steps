The road ends at a large portal here in the forest.  The portal itself is large and circular, with
sprays of color shooting across it, and strange, mystical energy flickering within.  A road into
Foundation lies to the east, while you can vaguely make out the outlines of a mysterious tower to
the west.  A small hut stands just to the north.

You are at the intersection of a wide grassy path which goes
east to west, and a well travelled road running north to
south.  You can see a strange multicolored haze off to the
west.  The colossal trees of the ancient forest prevent you
from seeing much else of note.

The majestic bulk of the Lodestone Building rears towards
the strange and mottled sky behind you to the east.  Arborlin

Once a long, narrow meadow stretching along the west side of
Foundation, it has become a narrow dirt trail pounded flat by
the passing feet of generations of adventurers and scoundrels.
Large buildings lie to north and west.  North lane lies to
the east while the dirt trail continues to the south.

Weird undulating tiles give way to the north to gleaming
pebbles and to the west to a small dirt path.  To the south
the looming bulk of the Lodestone Building arches toward a
mottled sky of purple and gold.  Light drops of rain fall.

The cobbles give way to a weird, twisting tile that makes
your stomach churn uneasily.  This must be Waverly Street.
You stand at an intersection where the cobbles of Main
Street, which stretches to the south, meet the stomach-
wrenching oddity of an undulating tile-covered path that
goes left to right.  Just to the north there is a small,
unimpressive brick building with a massive iron door.

Acid Eaten Forests
You've got to wonder how people could let such beauty be destroyed so
completely.  The trees around you almost seem to cry out in agony as
their limbs weaken under the relentless assault of industry's
by-products.  Yellowed leaves cling to drooping branches in this twisted
forest.  To the east you determine the continuation of the wasteland. 
The pollution filled waters of Lake Erie stretch out to the north and
west.

Acid Eaten Forests
You can only imagine how beautiful these forests must have once been,
before man and his progress shattered everything.  Soft, dark earth
gives way beneath your feet as you travel through the sickly forests of
the northeast.  Since the late twentieth century there have been
warnings about the effects of acid rain, but now with the mass increase
in industrialization and the radiation, the deforestation is at an all
time high.  Yellowed leaves cling to drooping branches in this twisted
forest.  To the north and south you almost miss the continuation of the
wasteland.

The Appalachian Mountains
Huge mountains rise up before you here. They look steep and dangerous. 
You've got to wonder how anything could survive way out here.  The trees
here are impressively tall. They tower above you hundreds of feet, but
for every tree there is a stump next to it.  To the south and east you
barely sense the continuation of the Appalachians.

The Appalachian Mountains
You can hear the roar of some far off motor. Who'd be way out here?  It
looks like you're in the mountains, high above the surrounding areas. 
The mountains rise up around you and cast huge shadows over the valleys
and cliffs that make up this incredible mountain range.  To the north
and east you determine the continuation of the Appalachians.  The
radioactive wreckage of Pittsburgh lie to the south.

their limbs weaken under the relentless assault of industry's
by-products.  Dark clouds blanket the sky, blotting out the sun and only
making this desolate forest that much more depressing.  To the south and

The entrance to Aegis Global can be seen just off to the west, a bit
of natural light streaming in from that direction.  Given your
proximity to that safety, you should probably leave while you still
can.  If you insist on exploring this building further, you could
venture east or south inside what's left of the once thriving
megacorp.

the blood streaked across the flatscreen monitors that line the inner

This is the entry to Aegis Global, a defense contractor that is
publically known to produce military armor and vehicles.  Privately,
it's rumored that this megacorp produces some much more diabolical
weapons.

Loose wiring has been torn from the walls in places, dangling in the

One of many typical intersections, very similar to streets in any other
city throughout the world. The only thing of interest is a long, low
building that borders the eastern side of the street. It's interesting
not so much because of its appearance, but because its double doors are
standing wide open.

Shreds of paper lie scattered everywhere in this room, littering the
office and partially covering the mess made of the furniture.  The
furniture, two cubes and a pair of chairs, are just about destroyed. 
Large tears mar the walls of the cubes and the chairs are bent into
shapes they were never meant to discover.

Your brief setting is currently: [on, no mapping]
  When traveling you will see the Short descriptions of rooms
  and you will not see the cardinal minimap.
--> You sense an approaching surge of chaotic energy <--
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!

Mmm, the delicious smell of cinnamon floats along the air in this
spacious corridor. The pungent spice seems to coat every surface you
can see. It flakes off the ceiling and walls and covers the floor in a
thin, fragrant layer. Cinnamon is said to be good for you, but you
might want to be careful. There's enough of it in here to choke a
horse.

=M= A tiny translucent bombardier beetle.
=M= A Giant Dulce De Leche Donut [wounded] [74%] !attacking you!.
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.
Your body ripples and shakes as energy flows into you.

Mmm, the delicious smell of cinnamon floats along the air in this
spacious corridor. The pungent spice seems to coat every surface you
can see. It flakes off the ceiling and walls and covers the floor in a
thin, fragrant layer. Cinnamon is said to be good for you, but you
might want to be careful. There's enough of it in here to choke a
horse.

17:03 Castiel : a new member
17:04 To: Castiel : the group is growing too big for me to hold everybody's
                    hand :P
17:08 Castiel : wastovan wont need much handholding
17:08 Castiel : dude has a phd in computer science
18:46 To: Wastovan : everything going alright?
18:54 Wastovan : I was afk for a mtg actually and just back here :0
21:02 To: Korenth : I don't suppose you can look at teepo blasters while you
                    are looking at jedis.  They definitely don't feel
                    comparatively great right now
05:43 Atropos : tanking upped, try it out
05:44 To: Atropos : I dig it!
05:45 To: Atropos : also like the changes to sp usage
05:58 To: Goo : tanking is upped :P
05:59 To: Goo : I like it when changelings get a little love
06:09 Atropos : i might break something so finish up mob and stay out of
                combat
06:10 To: Atropos : done
06:44 Hayt : in the client

06:53 Hayt : still workin on it
06:54 Castiel : yeah, it's a nice community of active players
17:42 To: Hayt : everything goin alright?
17:44 To: Goo : now I don't know what to do with my stats
17:44 To: Goo : because I don't want to reset twice
17:45 Goo : moar str
17:45 To: Goo : but 25 int is enough
17:45 To: Goo : I am still sorta bouncing off max sp
17:45 Goo : huh, my sp use seems the same, but i leave a/h on all the
            time
17:45 To: Goo : maybe a bit more would make me feel less anxious
17:45 To: Goo : me too
17:46 Goo : maybe a homestasis thing?
17:46 To: Goo : I leave them on all the time, but I feel like the sp usage
                is dramatically reduced.
17:46 To: Goo : with mystic I am still bouncing off my max (211)
17:46 To: Goo : doesn't seem likely that homeostasis affects it.. but
                maybe?
17:47 Goo : think i'm just going to have to add int to my hp bar.  i
            just know hyperp has turned off before because i was out
            of sps
17:47 To: Goo : I do not ever turn them off.. ever
17:48 To: Goo : I have 100 str/wis/con right now.  heh
17:48 To: Goo : 20 dex, 25 int, 20 cha
17:48 Dermi : look who i made it back to laugh
17:49 To: Goo : my damage is definitely worse
17:49 Goo : did the -dex do anything?  i have 30 :/
17:49 To: Goo : I don't think so.. I am going to leave it at 20
17:50 To: Goo : but otherwise, I can still kill blood eles and stuff.
17:50 To: Goo : I am.. not sure if I need more con.  heh
17:50 Goo : going to 25 int would give me 50 stat points to play with,
            sigh.  i forsee a reset in my future :P
17:50 To: Goo : just thinking about it for a while before I invest a bunch
17:51 To: Goo : yeah, talking to hayt earlier made me realize I wanted to
                reset int.. he noticed that he had way too much int.. and
                I realized I did too
17:51 To: Goo : I am at 25, and I really don't think more is necessary, at
                least with mystic
17:51 Goo : good thing is now i feel like i can play with more forms.

17:54 To: Goo : yeah, I think more forms would be my favorite
17:54 To: Goo : and I just ran out of sp
17:54 To: Goo : so I think I might need more int
17:54 To: Goo : maybe.. it really is only 1 wasted relinq so far
17:56 To: Goo : I'll think about it for a while longer before I decide..
                it's still pretty close
17:57 Goo : maybe just toss some mskills into spirituality too for
            some extra sps

Note 339 titled 'Sii Updates (Setinekht, Mon Jun 29 12:40:14 2020):
  Hello,
 
  Cullyn and I teamed up to provide some much needed maintenance to the Sii 
  guild. The guild has received a substantial update to both Quality of Life 
  and balance. Our main goal was to improve playability and the new Sii 
  player experience while giving the guild a better top end. 
 
  A few highlights to look forward to:
  * Broodlings have been redesigned and better integrated
  * Control sustainability issues have been addressed
  * A new command Analyze has been added to supplement
  your form's AC. This can add an AC that is missing
  or improve an existing form AC
  * Form mastery now matters
  * Stats have been better integrated
  * Demystification of things like skill progress, control level 
  and DNA progress by changing from descriptors to numbers
  * Form defense scales up to your current level so forms 
  don't become obsolete
  * Several bug repairs
  * Many more minor changes
 
  The entire change log is available on the Sii announce board in the guild. 
  Thanks to all who tested for us. 
 
  Cullyn and I are here to continue maintaining the guild. We look forward to 
  your feedback! 
 
  Setinekht

Fl dealt the killing blow to A Fire Elemental.
A Fire Elemental's impaled body crumples lifelessly to the ground.         
You pick up The electrocuted, freshly slain corpse of A fire elemental and wrap it up into the
coffin's protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
There are no coins here to share!
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a translucent bioplast with the raw
protoplasm you obtain.                                                     
bioplast: Taken.
Clone can't carry that much more.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

Decadently sweet banana creme is smeared all over the walls in here.
It's as if Curious George was given a tab of acid and then told to
have at it. Puddles of the sticky stuff congeal along the floor and it
drips from the ceiling too. The entire hallway is a bright shade of
yellow. It's also uncomfortably warm, like an oven that's just begun
to cool after a long baking session.

You are walking through the outer hall of the ancient Arachnecropolis. Massive stonework forms the
outer wall while the inner walls are shorter. The floor here slopes downward toward the center which
seems to be the focus of the necropolis. The sound of massive scraping, hairy spider legs create a
frightening backdrop to this evil place.

The Tarantula Lord disappears, reapearring behind you to run you through with acidic fangs!
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.

Tarantula Lord gurgles in its own blood as it dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Tarantula Lord.
Your reputation with League of Spider Slayers has increased slightly.
Tarantula Lord's impaled body crumples lifelessly to the ground.           
You pick up The glowing, freshly slain corpse of Tarantula lord and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 474 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 474 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a lucid bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.

Ok.

You are walking through the outer hall of the ancient Arachnecropolis. Massive stonework forms the
outer wall while the inner walls are shorter. The floor here slopes downward toward the center which
seems to be the focus of the necropolis. The sound of massive scraping, hairy spider legs create a
frigtening backdrop to this evil place.

=M= A tiny translucent bombardier beetle.
=M= An Undead Wolf Spider Lord [scratched] [94%] !attacking you!.
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!

The tiny translucent bombardier beetle gives A bioplast (translucent) to Fl.
You consume the translucent bioplast and immediately feel a surge of energy throughout your
